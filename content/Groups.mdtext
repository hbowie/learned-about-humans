Key Ideas: What is true for individuals is also often true for [[groups]], as smaller groups form relationships with other groups, including relationships of inclusion, and as groups grow in size. For example, groups develop identities, desire autonomy, pursue differentiation, engage in competition and have a sense of fair play.
