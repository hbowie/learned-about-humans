Class:  keystone

Key Ideas: When working with others as part of a group, or participating in a society to which we belong, we are guided by a sense of [[fair play]], marked by:

+ proportional equivalence between benefits and contributions;
+ consistent rules that are applied uniformly;
+ graduated sanctions that distinguish between initial and accidental violation of norms, as opposed to informed, intentional and persistent violations.
