I first came across Ken Wilber's work late in the last century when a friend handed me a copy of <cite>A Brief History of Everything</cite> as a birthday present.

Since then, Wilber's influence has been cited by figures as diverse as Bill Clinton and Deepak Chopra, which should give you some idea of how broadly his work can be applied. A [<cite>Salon</cite> interview][salon] with Wilber from back in 2008 is a good, brief introduction to the man and some of his thoughts.
