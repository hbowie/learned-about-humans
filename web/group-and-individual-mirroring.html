<p><em>aka: groups mirror individuals</em></p><p>Key Ideas: </p><p>Human groups tend to exhibit many of the same attributes and behaviors as do individual humans. In other words, what is true of individuals is often also true of groups. I think of this as <a href="group-and-individual-mirroring.html">group and individual mirroring</a>. </p>

<hr />
<p>What is true of individuals is also often true of groups. </p>

<p>For example, I&#8217;ve said that we all want to grow and <a href="development.html">develop</a>. But the societies that we form &#8211; the groups in which we participate &#8211; also have a tendency to grow and develop. </p>

<p>Human individuals tend to form groups, as I&#8217;ve already pointed out above. In other words, groups are composed of individuals. </p>

<p>But in larger organizations &#8211; larger <a href="society.html">societies</a>, if you will &#8211; groups can also be composed of other groups &#8211; or of individuals representing those other groups. </p>

<p>This sort of arrangement is evident in a typical hierarchical organization structure. </p>

<p>But one thing we will find is that the behaviors and motivations of individuals, in relationship to the group(s) to which they belong, also tend to be characteristic of groups, in relationship to the group(s) to which they belong. </p>

<p>This is why, when stating the <a href="core-design-principles-for-groups.html">Core Design Principles for Groups</a>, as formulated by <a href="wilson-david-sloan.html">David Sloan Wilson</a> and <a href="ostrom-elinor.html">Elinor Ostrom</a>, the final principle of polycentric governance states that: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>In large societies that consist of many groups, relationships among groups must embody the same principles as the relationships among individuals within groups. This means that the core design principles are <em>scale-independent</em>&#8230;. </p>
