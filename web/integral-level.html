<p><em>aka: integral/systemic level, systemic, Yellow, integrative</em></p><p>Key Ideas: </p><p>As individuals and societies develop through these levels, they have a tendency to become primarily focused on the values and social structures of one particular level. At the <a href="integral/systemic-level.html">systemic level</a> of development, though, people begin to appreciate the value of integrating the values and social structures associated with all of the prior levels into a more fluid, systemic approach that is able to select and combine elements in order to best respond to particular situations. </p>

<hr />
<p>This is one of several general <a href="developmental-levels.html">developmental levels</a> applicable to the development of both individuals and societies. </p>

<p>The Integral level of development recognizes that each preceding level addresses some aspect of reality that is necessary for human development, and in fact that any one of the preceding levels may need to be activated in certain life conditions. </p>

<p>Unlike each of the earlier levels that tend to experience the world only through their blinkered perspective, the integral level includes and transcends prior levels, and humans operating at this level tend to have flexible, dynamic, adaptive attitudes towards the social groups in which they participate. </p>

<p>Humans operating at this level tend to see existing social structures as systems that can be changed, rather than inflexible constructs, and may see themselves as change agents for systems, rather than players limited to operating within existing systems. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>When you grow up you tend to get told that the world is the way it is and your life is just to live your life inside the world. Try not to bash into the walls too much. Try to have a nice family, have fun, save a little money. </p>

<p>That&#8217;s a very limited life. Life can be much broader once you discover one simple fact: Everything around you that you call life was made up by people that were no smarter than you and you can change it, you can influence it, you can build your own things that other people can use. </p>
