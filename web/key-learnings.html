<p><a href="what-ive-learned-about-humans.html">What I've Learned About Humans</a>&nbsp;&#8593;</p><h3 id="key-learnings"> Key Learnings</h3>
<p>I&#8217;ve learned some important things about humans over the years. </p><p>1. We are naturally <a href="society.html">social</a>, in that we create and sustain and participate in human societies of varying structures and sizes. </p>

<p>2. We all want to grow and <a href="development.html">develop</a>. We take different paths, and proceed at different rates, but the drive to develop is present in all of us, from inception onwards. </p>

<p>3. Human groups tend to exhibit many of the same attributes and behaviors as do individual humans. In other words, what is true of individuals is often also true of groups. I think of this as <a href="group-and-individual-mirroring.html">group and individual mirroring</a>. </p>

<p>4. We develop languages and vocabularies that we can use to communicate with one another. <a href="language.html">Language</a> is the most basic glue that we humans rely on when forming cooperative societies. </p>

<p>5. Much of our human behavior is learned, <a href="flexible-and-adaptive-behavior.html">flexible and adaptive</a>. </p>

<p>6. We humans often take into account multiple perspectives on a thing or situation, do our best to integrate these different views into some coherent mental model, and then decide upon some action based upon a balanced consideration. We can think of this as taking an <a href="integration-of-multiple-perspectives.html">integral approach</a>. </p>

<p>7. We tend to perceive reality from four different perspectives, often referred as <a href="the-four-quadrants.html">the four quadrants</a>. Understanding these perspectives as four valid and complementary ways of perceiving the world is a good first step to obtaining an integral outlook. We can think of these as the <a href="individual-subjective.html">individual subjective</a>, the <a href="individual-objective.html">individual objective</a>, the <a href="social-objective.html">social objective</a> and the <a href="social-subjective.html">social subjective</a>. </p>

<p>8. Lower-level needs must be attended to before consideration can be given to higher-level desires. As a result, we can conceive of a range of influencing factors being arranged into a <a href="motivational-hierarchy.html">motivational hierarchy</a>. </p>

<p>9. We find it natural to <a href="cooperation.html">work cooperatively</a> with other humans in order to achieve shared objectives. </p>

<p>10. We are able to cooperate with other humans in uniquely <a href="flexible-cooperation.html">flexible and adaptive ways</a>. </p>

<p>12. We all want to experience a large degree of <a href="autonomy.html">autonomy</a>. We want to have options available to us, and we don&#8217;t want our decisions and actions to be coerced. </p>

<p>13. We are inquisitive and creative and retentive. We learn about the world around us and we invent new objects and structures for interacting with other humans and with the natural world. We embed these learnings and inventions into shared <a href="culture.html">cultures</a> used by our societies, and pass these down from one generation to the next. </p>

<p>14. Our cultures change and develop over time, in a process sometimes referred to as <a href="cultural-evolution.html">cultural evolution</a>. </p>

<p>15. When working with others as part of a group, or participating in a society to which we belong, we are guided by a sense of <a href="fair-play.html">fair play</a>, marked by: </p>

<ul>
<li>proportional equivalence between benefits and contributions; </li>
<li>consistent rules that are applied uniformly; </li>
<li>graduated sanctions that distinguish between initial and accidental violation of norms, as opposed to informed, intentional and persistent violations. </li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>16. We all crave <a href="meaning.html">meaning</a> in our lives. Meaning is a subjective sense of the significance of our actions, perceptions, judgments and recollections. Meaning often derives from a sense of purpose, and is often an intersubjective sense that arises from the cooperative efforts of a group. </p>

<p>17. We seek <a href="differentiation.html">differentiation</a> from others with similar intentions, in order to form and sustain our own identities. When we participate in groups, we like to feel that we make some unique contributions. </p>

<p>18. Differentiation often leads to <a href="competition.html">competition</a>. </p>

<p>19. What is true for individuals is also often true for <a href="groups.html">groups</a>, as smaller groups form relationships with other groups, including relationships of inclusion, and as groups grow in size. For example, groups develop identities, desire autonomy, pursue differentiation, engage in competition and have a sense of fair play. </p>

<p>20. We all need to balance periods of work &#8211; activity focused on producing a needed set of outputs &#8211; with periods of <a href="relaxation-and-play.html">relaxation and play</a> &#8211; time spent without the necessity of useful production. </p>

<p>21. We humans and our societies tend to develop through a series of  <a href="developmental-levels.html">levels</a>. Later levels don&#8217;t supersede earlier levels, but rather complement earlier ones, adding additional capabilities. Each level is characterized by certain sorts of intersubjective feelings, as well as certain sorts of objective social structures. </p>

<p>26. We humans are often subject to <a href="conflicted.html">conflicting</a> and sometimes contradictory feelings and motivations. This is part and parcel of the human experience, and not necessarily an indication of any sort of flaw in ourselves, in our societies, or in the cosmos. </p>

<p>27. An essential function for any society is the ongoing development of its members. </p>
