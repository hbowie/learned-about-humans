<p><em>aka: cultures</em></p><p>Key Ideas: </p><p>We are inquisitive and creative and retentive. We learn about the world around us and we invent new objects and structures for interacting with other humans and with the natural world. We embed these learnings and inventions into shared <a href="culture.html">cultures</a> used by our societies, and pass these down from one generation to the next. </p>

<hr />
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture">Wikipedia&#8217;s entry</a> offers a useful summary of what we mean by <em>culture</em>: </p>

<blockquote>

<p>[Culture encompasses]&#8230; the range of phenomena that are transmitted through social learning in human societies. The concept of material culture covers the physical expressions of culture, such as technology, architecture and art, whereas the immaterial aspects of culture such as principles of social organization (including practices of political organization and social institutions), mythology, philosophy, literature (both written and oral), and science comprise the intangible cultural heritage of a society. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>In other words, culture consists of the knowledge, beliefs, artifacts, attitudes, practices, and institutions that are shared by a group of people, and transmitted socially between members of that group. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>With this perspective, you can begin to think of yourself as not just a product of your genes, and not just a product of your personal experience, but also as one of many members of your culture who collectively contain a vast repository of information learned and passed down from previous generations. This makes you part of something larger than yourself. The information has not just been passed down, but it has also been <em>winnowed</em> through the generations, leaving us with a set of beliefs and practices that helped us to cohere as groups. </p>
