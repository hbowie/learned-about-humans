<p><em>aka: levels, developmental level</em></p><p>Key Ideas: </p><p>We humans and our societies tend to develop through a series of  <a href="developmental-levels.html">levels</a>. Later levels don&#8217;t supersede earlier levels, but rather complement earlier ones, adding additional capabilities. Each level is characterized by certain sorts of intersubjective feelings, as well as certain sorts of objective social structures. </p>

<hr />
<p>A number of authors and systems of thought espouse one or another series of developmental levels, in fields of study as diverse as psychology, sociology, economics and organizational development. <a href="wilber-ken.html">Ken Wilber</a> was the first author I encountered who proposed an integration of these various developmental progressions into a single unifying scheme. However, much of Ken&#8217;s take  on these levels was heavily influenced by the <a href="spiral-dynamics-mastering-values-leadership-and-change.html">Spiral Dynamics</a> work done by <a href="beck-don-edward-and-cowan-christopher.html">Beck and Cowan</a>, which was in turn based on work done by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clare_W._Graves">Clare W. Graves</a>. </p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow%27s_hierarchy_of_needs">Maslow&#8217;s hierarchy of needs</a> is probably one of the better known examples of this sort of developmental model. </p>

<p>So what do we mean by a level of development, in this context? </p>

<p>Here&#8217;s where it gets a little tricky. </p>

<p>Both in terms of individual development, and in terms of sociocultural development, these levels seem to emerge in a certain sequence. </p>

<p>However, later levels do not supersede or invalidate earlier levels. Rather than replacing previous levels, each emergent level expands the complexity and capacity of individuals and societies. </p>

<p>And so Wilber and Beck and Cowan have tried to use colors to identify the levels, rather than numbers, in order to avoid giving the impression that later levels are somehow superior to earlier levels. </p>

<p>At some point along the line, though, Ken Wilber and the Integral crew decided it was important to change some of the colors. I&#8217;ve listed both the original Spiral Dynamics colors and the newer Integral colors in the table below, but in general I will stick with the original colors from Beck and Cowan. </p>

<p>Also, there has been a later tendency to add new, higher, levels to the upper end of this range. I&#8217;ve not been able to make much sense of these, myself, so I&#8217;m omitting them here. </p>

<p>As we go through these levels, we will see that each one has a particular <a href="subjective.html">subjective</a>, or <a href="social-subjective.html">intersubjective</a> viewpoint, as well as typical social structures that can be identified from an <a href="objective.html">objective</a> perspective. </p>

<p>There&#8217;s a certain chicken and the egg sort of dilemma we face when trying to disentangle the objective social aspects of a level from its subjective aspects but, for me, it feels more natural to consider the objective social aspects first, so I&#8217;ll proceed in that manner. </p>

<p>Also, it&#8217;s worth noting that, as we proceed through the levels, they tend to alternate between an assertion of individual power (archaic, tribal, modern, integral), followed by a more community-based perspective (magical, traditional, postmodern). </p>

<p>Here&#8217;s a table listing all of the levels, with their associated colors. I have omitted the Turquoise (holistic) and Coral levels because they both seem to me to be vague and aspirational and not particularly useful (at least for my purposes). </p>

<blockquote>
<p>To grasp what is involved with levels or stages, let&#8217;s use a very simple model possessing only 3 of them. If we look at moral development, for example, we find that an infant at birth has not yet been socialized into the culture&#8217;s ethics and conventions: this is called the <strong>preconventional stage</strong>. It is also called <strong>egocentric</strong>, in that the infant&#8217;s awareness is largely self-absorbed. But as the young child begins to learns its culture&#8217;s rules and norms, it grows into the <strong>conventional stage</strong> of morals. This stage is also called <strong>ethnocentric</strong>, in that it centers on the child&#8217;s particular group, tribe, clan, or nation, and it therefore tends to exclude those not of its group. But at the next major stage of moral development, the <strong>postconventional stage</strong>, the individual&#8217;s identity expands once again, this time to include a care and concern for all peoples, regardless of race, color, sex or creed, which is why this stage is also called <strong>worldcentric</strong>. </p>

<p>Thus, moral development tends to move from &#8216;me&#8217; (egocentric) to &#8216;us&#8217; (ethnocentric) to &#8216;all of us&#8217; (worldcentric) &#8211; a good example of the unfolding waves of consciousness. </p>
