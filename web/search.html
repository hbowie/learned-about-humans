        content: "A number of authors and systems of thought espouse one or another series of developmental levels in fields of study as diverse as psychology sociology economics and organizational development Ken Wilber was the first author I encountered who proposed an integration of these various developmental progressions into a single unifying scheme However much of Ken s take on these levels was heavily influenced by the Spiral Dynamics work done by Beck and Cowan which was in turn based on work done by Clare W Graves graves Maslow s hierarchy of needs https en wikipedia org wiki Maslow 27s hierarchy of needs is probably one of the better known examples of this sort of developmental model So what do we mean by a level of development in this context Here s where it gets a little tricky Both in terms of individual development and in terms of sociocultural development these levels seem to emerge in a certain sequence However later levels do not supersede or invalidate earlier levels Rather than replacing previous levels each emergent level expands the complexity and capacity of individuals and societies And so Wilber and Beck and Cowan have tried to use colors to identify the levels rather than numbers in order to avoid giving the impression that later levels are somehow superior to earlier levels At some point along the line though Ken Wilber and the Integral crew decided it was important to change some of the colors I ve listed both the original Spiral Dynamics colors and the newer Integral colors in the table below but in general I will stick with the original colors from Beck and Cowan Also there has been a later tendency to add new higher levels to the upper end of this range I ve not been able to make much sense of these myself so I m omitting them here As we go through these levels we will see that each one has a particular subjective or intersubjective viewpoint as well as typical social structures that can be identified from an objective perspective There s a certain chicken and the egg sort of dilemma we face when trying to disentangle the objective social aspects of a level from its subjective aspects but for me it feels more natural to consider the objective social aspects first so I ll proceed in that manner Also it s worth noting that as we proceed through the levels they tend to alternate between an assertion of individual power archaic tribal modern integral followed by a more community based perspective magical traditional postmodern Here s a table listing all of the levels with their associated colors I have omitted the Turquoise holistic and Coral levels because they both seem to me to be vague and aspirational and not particularly useful at least for my purposes beck https en wikipedia org wiki Don

        content: "It was modern American philosopher Ken Wilber who had the insight that when we look at the many perspectives that we humans can take on a topic these perspectives can often usefully be categorized into one of four quadrants that together make up a more balanced view of reality The four quadrants are formed by the intersection of two dimensions The first dimension left or right can be expressed as either interior or exterior The second dimension up or down can be expressed as either individual or collective Combining these we get the four quadrants UL Interior of an Individual Upper Left 8212 This is reality viewed from the 8216 I 8217 perspective what things look like and feel like to me as an individual As an example <a href= http en wikipedia org wiki Category Freudian psychology >Freudian psychology< a> is based on this perspective UR Exterior of an Individual Upper Right 8212 This is reality viewed from an 8220 it 8221 perspective In psychology <a href= http en wikipedia org wiki Behaviorism >Skinner 8217 s behaviorism< a> is an example Knowledge is based on observation of the behavior of individuals acting in isolation without reference to any interior feeling states LL Interior of a Collective Lower Left This is reality viewed from the We perspective what things feel like to us as a collective Cultural studies are based on this perspective elucidating how things feel to a group based on the collective norms and values of the group LR Exterior of a Collective Lower Right This is reality viewed from the They perspective based on the observable behavior of a group Sociology studies are generally based on this perspective and include the behaviors of a society An understanding of these four quadrants of perception is useful because it helps us understand that very different views of reality Freudian psychology vs Skinner s behaviorism for example are not contradictory or mutually exclusive but rather are complementary Views from all of these different perspectives may be equally valid even if they are very different ways of looking at the world Note that the two exterior right hand views are often lumped together for purposes of discussion It s worth noting that Yuval Noah Harari in his book Sapiens A Brief History of Humankind uses the terms subjective inter subjective and objective to describe respectively the upper left lower left and right hand sides of Wilber s quadrant defining them like this An objective right hand phenomenon exists independently of human consciousness and human beliefs The subjective upper left is something that exists depending on the consciousness and beliefs of a single individual It disappears or changes if that particular individual changes his or her beliefs The inter subjective lower left is something that exists within the communication network linking the subjective consciousness of many individuals If a single individual changes his or her beliefs or even dies it is of little importance However if most individuals in the network die or change their beliefs the inter subjective phenomenon will mutate or disappear Wilber has explained some of these differences of perspective as follows > If you are talking to me about your new car you are the first person I am the second person and the car is the third person These pronouns actually represent three perspectives that human beings can take when they talk about the world or attempt to know the world The fascinating part is that these three perspectives might actually give rise to art morals and science Or the Beautiful the Good and the True the Beauty that is in the eye or the I of the beholder the Good or moral actions that can exist between you and me as a we and the objective Truth about third person objects or its that you and I might discover hence art I morals we and science it While this is a useful explanation I tend to think of Art as a human activity that ties these perspectives together in the following way based on observation of nature and society it and or they an individual an I expresses his or her interior reality creating an object observable by others an it that gains an appreciative audience a we and thereby establishes a shared interior reality In this way I believe that Art uniquely helps to tie these different perspectives together providing an integrated holistic view of human experience The Four Quadrants model can be applied in all sorts of contexts which is part of what makes it so useful Let me give you a couple of business examples Take a look at the following words from Rob Austin in his insightful little book <cite> Measuring and Managing Performance in Organizations < cite> > One frequent analogy casts the manager in the role of an airplane pilot guided by organizational measures that are like cockpit instruments > > Mechanistic and organic analogies are flawed because they are too simplistic Kaplan and Norton s cockpit analogy would be more accurate if it included a multitude of tiny gremlins controlling wing flaps fuel flow and so on of a plane being buffeted by winds and generally struggling against nature but with the gremlins always controlling information flow back to the cockpit instruments for fear that the pilot might find gremlin replacements It would not be surprising if airplanes guided this way occasionally flew into mountainsides when they seemed to be progressing smoothly toward their destinations Note that Rob starts with exterior perspectives of collectives a manager guiding an organization and a pilot flying an aircraft But then he goes on to expose the interior feeling fear of individuals who are not only being guided but being asked to objectively report the data on which their performance will be graded He then suggests the sort of culture interior such a collective of gremlins might develop in such conditions and what sort of collective behavior they might exhibit So while Austin may not have consciously or explicitly referred to the Four Quadrants model seeing his work as an example of this model may help us gain similarly powerful insights in other situations Here is another example from <cite> Toyota Culture The Heart and Soul of The Toyota Way < cite> by Jeffrey Liker and Mike Hoseus Here Mike tells a story of learning first hand some of the elements of the Toyota culture > As a new group leader I was sent to Tsutsumi to spend a month getting an appreciation of working on the line and mastering one process The team leaders told us no one would be able to complete the whole job by the end of the month but I was determined to prove them wrong I was installing liners underneath the wheel well when my air gun slipped and the driver bit scratched the paint on the inner lip of the wheel well I gasped and looked around no one saw me do it but they had told me to pull the andon rope cord if I made or caught any defect It was my moment of truth My first reaction was to let it go No one would probably see the scratch anyway and no one would know that I made it But my conscience got the best of me and I wanted to see if they really meant what they said about admitting mistakes So I pulled the andon and the team leader came to fix the problem and showed me how to hold the bit with a free finger in order to stabilize it better But he did not seem angry at me for making the scratch > > Then at break we gathered for our afternoon group meeting where the group leader gave out information on safety and quality issues and heard back concerns from the members > > They spoke Japanese so I could not understand what they were saying until I heard the words Mike san Well that got my attention so I listened carefully more Japanese and then scratchee scratchee and then more Japanese So here it was finally I was going to get called out for messing up and they were going to do it in front of everyone Then all of a sudden the whole group looked at me and clapped and smiled and patted my back and shook my hand as they headed back to the line I couldn t believe it after double checking with an interpreter just to make sure they were applauding me because I made a mistake and admitted it I felt like a million bucks and guess what I did the next time I made a mistake Notice how the story talks about individual behavior Exterior of an Individual group behavior Exterior of a Collective individual feelings Interior of an Individual and group culture Interior of a Collective And while these are four distinct perspectives they are all describing the same set of events Note also that while these are distinctly different perspectives they are not unrelated quite the opposite in fact Mike s story clearly shows how an individual and then a group responded to an event how the culture was evidenced by the group s behavior and then how that behavior made an individual feel which influenced his future feelings and behavior This is the beauty of the Four Quadrants model in that it gives us a complete picture of reality and increases our understanding of that reality Many lean transformation efforts fail for example because they are focused only on productivity improvements Exterior of a Collective and fail to instill the corresponding cultural elements necessary to support the desired behavior austin http www cbs dk en research departments and
