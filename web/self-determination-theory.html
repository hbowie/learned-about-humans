<p><em>aka: SDT</em></p><p>Link: <a href="https://www.urmc.rochester.edu/community-health/patient-care/self-determination-theory.aspx">https://www.urmc.rochester.edu/community-health/patient-care/self-determination-theory.aspx</a></p><p>Self-determination theory suggests that all humans have three basic psychological needs &#8211; autonomy, competence, and relatedness &#8211; that underlie growth and development. </p>

<ul>
<li><p>Autonomy refers to feeling one has choice and is willingly endorsing one’s behavior. The opposite experience is feeling compelled or controlled in one’s behavior. </p></li>
<li><p>Competence refers to the experience of mastery and being effective in one’s activity. </p></li>
<li><p>Relatedness refers to the need to feel connected and a sense of belongingness with others. </p></li>
</ul>
