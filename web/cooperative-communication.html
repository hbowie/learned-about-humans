<blockquote>
<p>What allowed us to thrive while other humans went extinct was a kind of cognitive superpower: a particular type of friendliness called cooperative communication. We are experts at working together with other people, even strangers. We can communicate with someone we&#8217;ve never met about a shared goal and work together to accomplish it. </p>
