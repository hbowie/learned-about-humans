<p><em>aka: integral approach</em></p><p>Key Ideas: </p><p>We humans often take into account multiple perspectives on a thing or situation, do our best to integrate these different views into some coherent mental model, and then decide upon some action based upon a balanced consideration. We can think of this as taking an <a href="integration-of-multiple-perspectives.html">integral approach</a>. </p>

<hr />
<p>We humans have the ability to see things &#8211; people, events, circumstances &#8211; from more than one perspective. </p>

<p>More than that, things appear <em>differently</em> when we view them from different perspectives. </p>

<p>In other words, you and I may observe the same event, or consider the same issue, and yet see that same event or issue very differently. </p>

<p>Not only that, but a single person may view an event or issue from multiple perspectives. </p>

<p>Here&#8217;s an example of what I mean that I came across recently in the news. It&#8217;s an excerpt from an <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/obama-haitian-migrants-plight-heartbreaking-biden-system-broken/story?id=80267478">interview with former US President Barack Obama</a>, speaking about immigration into America. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>Immigration is tough. It always has been because, on the one hand, I think we are naturally a people that wants to help others. And we see tragedy and hardship and families that are desperately trying to get here so that their kids are safe, and they&#8217;re in some cases fleeing violence or catastrophe. At the same time, we&#8217;re a nation state. We have borders. The idea that we can just have open borders is something that &#8230; as a practical matter, is unsustainable. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>If we consider Obama&#8217;s words for a moment, we can easily see that he&#8217;s describing two different perspectives on a single issue. </p>

<ul>
<li>First there is what we might call an <em>empathic</em> perspective: we see people who are hurting and we want to help them, or want them to be helped; </li>
<li>Second there is what we might call a <em>systemic</em> perspective, describing our current system of world and national governance, with nation-states and borders and legal systems. </li>
</ul>

<p>But this way of considering issues, through consideration of multiple perspectives, is not unique to Obama, or to the topic of immigration: it&#8217;s just part and parcel of how we humans have learned to deal with the world around us. </p>

<p>So what do we <em>do</em> with these varied points of view? </p>

<p>It&#8217;s often tempting &#8211; and certainly simpler &#8211; to bless one view as the &#8220;right&#8221; one, and ignore or reject all others as false. </p>

<p>It&#8217;s more challenging &#8211; but sometimes more useful, and at times more equitable &#8211; to try to <em>integrate</em> these varied perspectives into a more comprehensive understanding of a person, event or issue. </p>

<p>When we try to integrate varied perspectives in this way, we can think of this broadly as taking an <em>integral</em> approach. </p>
