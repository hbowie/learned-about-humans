Title:  Seq Field

Seq:    6.2

Level:  3

Body:

The Seq field establishes the reading order for the pages of the book. 

Every Note will be given a unique Seq value in order to establish an unambiguous reading order. 

The Seq value will be segmented, with each position being incremented according to the Note's [[Level value]].

By convention the first page of the book becomes the title page, and is given a blank Seq value.
