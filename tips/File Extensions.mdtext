Title:  File Extensions

Seq:    4

Level:  2

Body:

I'm using the file extension of '`.mdtext`' to identify Notes within Notenik Collections, including, but not limited to, the original source files containing the website content. 

I use this uncommon file extension to indicate that these are text files that are partially formatted using Markdown.
